		The LuaObject class provides methods to access the associated Lua state and retrieve object pointers.
		
		This class serves as the foundation for interacting with Lua objects from GDScript. It allows you to:
		- Get the Lua state associated with the object
		- Retrieve the pointer value of the Lua object
		
		Note: This is an abstract base class and should not be instantiated directly.
